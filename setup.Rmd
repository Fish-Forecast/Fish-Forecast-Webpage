## Install R and RStudio

* **R:**  Make sure you have the latest version of R.  
Go to [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/) and find the download link for your computer system.

* **RStudio:** Install the latest version of RStudio.  Get it from [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download) and install the appropriate one for your OS.

For full set-up instructions including Git and GitHub (optional), go to [full setup](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/Fish-Forecast-Training-Course/set-up.html)

## Download Files and Packages

1. Go to https://github.com/Fish-Forecast/Catch-Forecasting-Files and copy all the files into a directory.

- If GitHub Desktop works for you, then you can click 'Clone or download' and then click open in Desktop.

- If GitHub Desktop is not working for you, then click 'Clone or download' and then download a zip file and unzip on your computer.

2. Open RStudio and 'New Project' in the upper right.  Then select 'From Existing Directory' and select the directory where you put the 'Catch-Forecasting-Files' files are.

3. Next time you open RStudio, you can select your project from the upper right..

2. Install **other packages** that we are going to be need. I have created a package on GitHub that will install the packages you need.  This will probably take **awhile** as the first time you do it, many packages will be loaded.

```{r get-packages, eval=FALSE}
if(!("devtools" %in% installed.packages()))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RVerse-Tutorials/RWorkflowsetup")
```

The RWorkflowsetup package will install the packages listed under "Imports:"
<pre>
```{r get-DESC, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
desc <- RCurl::getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RVerse-Tutorials/RWorkflowsetup/master/DESCRIPTION")
#desc <- stringr::str_replace_all(desc, "\n", "</br>\n")
cat(desc)
```
</pre>
