This course will teach a number of standard approaches for forecasting from catch time series using the data and methods discussed in Stergiou and Christou (1996) Modelling and forecasting annual fisheries catches: comparison of regression, univariate and multivariate time series methods. Fisheries Research 25: 105-136.
